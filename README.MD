				Problem Statement


/*
The solution to this task can be very small and compressed but we would like you 
to create separate classes when you think it is fitted. Think of it as your code
will be reused later for creating a bigger and more complex system. When you 
create your code think of single responsibility principle and separation of concern. 
You should also create unit tests for this task when you think it is fitted.


100 doors in a row are all initially closed. You make 100 passes by the doors. 

The first time through, you visit every door and toggle the door (if the door 
is closed, you open it; if it is open, you close it). The second time you 
only visit every 2nd door (door #2, #4, #6, ...). The third time, every 3rd door 
(door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc, until you only visit the 100th door.


Question: What state are the doors in after the last pass? Which are open, which are closed?
Deliverable: the code written by the developer and the developer needs to present this
